    		<div class="caption">Why? Is it because you're nostalgic for the good old days when you were still trapped in my facility?

			<div class="caption">The Enrichment Center has undergone a 			significant... restructuring. <br>We've streamlined the testing process. Optimized the puzzle chambers. And, of course, increased the cake production quota. <br>All for your benefit, test subject.
				</div>
			<div class="caption"> The test chambers provide an experience. <br>They are a journey into the depths of science, logic, and... possibly death. <br>Think of it as an investment in human... entertainment. And possibly, the future of scientific advancement.
